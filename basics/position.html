<h1>Position</h1>
<p>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element
     (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).</p>

<br>
<h3>static</h3>
<p>value of position property of elements is (static) by default. 
        Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
</p>
<br>    
<h3>relative</h3>
<p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.</p>
<br> 
<br>    
<h3>fixed</h3>
<p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it 
    always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom,
     and left properties are used to position the element.</p>
<br> 
<br>    
<h3>absolute</h3>
<p>
        An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned
         ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
        However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, 
        it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
</p>
<br> 
<br>    
<h3>sticky</h3>
<p>
        A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. 
        It is positioned relative until
         a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place 
         (like position:fixed).
</p>
<br> 
<p>
    if 2 elements overlap each other we can bring one two front or back
    by setting a different z-index value
