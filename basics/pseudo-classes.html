<h1>Pseudo-classes</h1>
<p>
  an html element can have different states in when it is rendered in DOM. we do not have know what state it could be
  at each time but we can set it to behave as we want on those states. these states are defined by pseudo-classes
</p>
<p>for example a pseudo class can be used to :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Style an element when a user mouses over it</li>
  <li>Style visited and unvisited links differently</li>
  <li>Style an element when it gets focus</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">Note: <span class="boldword">a:hover</span> MUST come after a:link and <span class="boldword">a:visited</span>
  in the CSS definition in order to be effective!
  <span class="boldword">a:active</span> MUST come after <span class="boldword">a:hover</span> in the CSS definition in
  order to be effective! Pseudo-class names are not
  case-sensitive
</div>

<pre>
  an example of pseudo classes :
  a.highlight:hover {
  color: #ff0000;
  }
</pre>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>pseudo classes can be used to take an state as an event and plan an action based on that like showing a tool tip
  when hovering over a div element</p>

<div style="border: 3px solid greenyellow">
  hover over me
  <p class="tooltip">and this is the tool tip</p>
</div>

<br>
