  <p>Display is an attribute to define visibility of the element</p>
  <br>
<p>
  The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.
  Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is.
  The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
</p>
<h2>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full 
  width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can)</h2>
<h2>some of the block level elements are</h2>
<ul>
  <li>div</li>
  <li>h1 - h6</li>
  <li>p</li>
  <li>form</li>
  <li>header</li>
  <li>footer</li>
  <li>li</li>
  <li>section</li>
</ul>
<h2>An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary</h2>
<h2>some of the inline elements are</h2>
<ul>
  <li>span</li>
  <li>a</li>
  <li>img</li>
</ul>
<p>Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to none. The element will be hidden, 
  and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there</p>
<p>
    However, the element will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden
    , but still affect the layout
</p>

<h2 style="color:red">Using width, max-width and margin: auto;</h2>
<br>
<p>
    As mentioned in the previous chapter; a block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

    Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container. Then, you can set the margins to auto,
     to horizontally center the element within its container. The element will take up the specified width, and
      the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins
</p>

<p>
    Note: The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element. The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

        Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows. This is important when making a site usable on small devices:
</p>

<br>

<div class="ex1">This div element has width: 500px;</div>
<br>

<div class="ex2">This div element has max-width: 500px;</div>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, to see the difference between 
the two divs!</p>
