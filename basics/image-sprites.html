<h1>Image Sprites</h1>
<p>image sprites are a way to put all images in one image then when we need one of those images we reference an address
  to its position on the sprite </p>

<div class="note">however an image sprite might not make so much difference now a days websites using http/2
  since http/2 is using <span class="boldword">multiplexing</span> to load all images over a single tcp connection.
  but it is still more performant to use sprites.

  but that is not the only case because icon-fonts and svg elements are a much accepted and newer solution
</div>
